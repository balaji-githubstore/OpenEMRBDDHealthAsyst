  Scenario Outline: Add Patient
    Given I have browser with OpenEMR page
    When I enter username as '<username>'
    And I enter password as '<password>'
    And I select language as 'English (Indian)'
    And I click on login
    And I click on patient-client
    And I click on patient
    And I click on Add New Patient
    And I fill the form
      | firstname   | lastname   | dob   | gender   |
      | <firstname> | <lastname> | <dob> | <gender> |
    And I click on create new patient
    And I click on confirm create new patient
    And I store the text and handle the alert box
    And I click on happy birthday if available
    Then the alert text should contains  '<expectedAlert>'
    And I should get the added patient name '<expectedName>'
